Future developments
-------------------

* Split postpone to [time] into a appear_at and due_on time span.
* Allow users to add todos via email and SMS.
* In addition to the daily reminders, implement a more finely email/sms based reminder system.
* Consider task-stringing (don't show this task until the last one is done).
* Implement context sensing based on WiFi networks (or location data).
